## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Typescript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS framework
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Svelte application framework

### What I learned

In this project, I used typescript for the first time and got to learn it in the process.

While working with svelte transition, I failed couple of times and finally found right way to do it. Moreover, I forced me to dive deeper into docs and learn more how the framework works(implements certain things).

I used basic geometry knowledge to positions those symbol buttons. P.S definitely proud of myself coming with this solution.

### Continued development

I'm quite satisfied with the outcome. However, there is definitely room for improvements.

- More cleaner transitions and animations.
- More optimal layouts.
- Learning about svg graphics would be cool.

### Useful resources

- [Svelte Tutorials](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/deferred-transitions) - Really clear explaination and neat example code. Definitely recommended for first time lerners. Docs are also helpful.
